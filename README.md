## 📖 About Treegen

**_Treegen_** is a powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to simplify the process of creating complex directory structures. It allows users to generate an entire file and folder structure from an ASCII tree representation. This can be incredibly useful for quickly setting up project structures or replicating folder structures.

## ⬇️ Download
The easiest way to install treegen is using `go install`.

    go install github.com/bilbilak/treegen

## 🛠️ Usage

```sh
# To generate a file structure you need to pass an ASCII representation of the file structure

## From a file
treegen tree_structure.txt

## From stdin using redirections
cat tree_structure.txt | treegen

treegen < tree_structure.txt

treegen <<-EOF
  /path/to/project/
  ├── src/
  │   └── main.js
  ├── LICENSE.md
  └── README.md
EOF
```
