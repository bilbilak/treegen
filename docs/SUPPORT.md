# Support Policy

We're happy to help you with any questions or issues you may have regarding our project. This document outlines the various channels through which you can seek support and guidance.

## ‚ùì Questions and Answers (Q&A)

For general questions and discussions, please use the [Discussion Board](https://github.com/bilbilak/treegen/discussions/categories/q-a) of the project. This platform allows you to engage in conversations with the maintainers and other contributors, to ask your questions and participate in the polls.

For an alternative and more engaging environment, join our [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/bilbilak) to ask questions, share your experiences, and connect with other users in a community-driven atmosphere.


### Asking Quality Questions

Before asking a new question, please search for similar topics on _Google_, _Reddit_, _Stack Overflow_, or _GitHub_ to see if your question has already been addressed.

When seeking help or asking questions, it's essential to provide clear and concise information. This enables the community to understand your issue and provide more accurate and helpful answers. The more time you put into asking your question, the better we can help you. Keep the following points in mind when asking questions:

- Provide context and be specific about the problem you are facing.
- Share relevant code snippets, logs, or error messages.
- Consider creating a [Minimal, Reproducible Example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to illustrate your issue.
- Be aware of the [XY Problem](https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/66377/what-is-the-xy-problem/66378#66378) and ensure you're asking about your actual issue, rather than a potential solution you've considered.

Before posting your question, try [Talking to a Duck](https://rubberduckdebugging.com)! Sometimes, explaining the problem to someone else can help you find the solution on your own.
