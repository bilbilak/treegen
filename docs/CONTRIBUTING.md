We appreciate your interest in contributing to this project! This document outlines the process for submitting code, documentation, or other types of contributions. Please read and follow these guidelines to ensure a smooth collaboration with the project maintainers.

## üíª Setting up your development environment

    - If you are new to forking repositories, you can find a detailed guide on forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).
2. Clone your fork to your local development environment:
    ```
    git clone git@github.com:bilbilak/treegen.git
    cd bilbilak
    ```
3. Make sure you have the necessary tools installed, such as _Go_ and any dependencies required by the project.

**NOTE:** If you'd like to contribute to our documentation, please use [MyRepos](https://myrepos.branchable.com) tool to clone the project's _Wiki_. You can initiate the clone by running `mr checkout` as configured in the `.mrconfig` file. This will create the sub-repository under the `docs/wiki/` directory, separate from the main repository. To interact with this sub-repository, it's important to familiarize yourself with other `mr` commands.
